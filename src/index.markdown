# Mortimer

You could label **Mortimer** an Enterprise Resource Planning system and be right - perhaps even more so than
quite a few other offerings carrying that attachment!

The keyword here is _Resource_. Mortimer is designed to manage the resources, also very often referred to 
as assets, of a business. Most other ERP systems are designed to manage the financial aspects of a business,
which really is only one aspect of the business, only one of the _resources_.

Mortimer is not focused on the 'money' resource, as much as it is focused on the other resources: Manpower,
Equipment, and Materials.

## What is Mortimer?

Mortimer is a system for managing the business of a small to medium sized business. It is designed to be
flexible and extensible, and to be able to be used in a variety of ways. It is not a one-size-fits-all
solution, but it is designed to be able to be used in a variety of ways.
