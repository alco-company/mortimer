# Employees

## Management tasks pertaining to employees

Managing employeees is a big challenge to any organization because employees are the single most valuable asset to almost any business!

Three main categories of management tasks stand out:

1. Attract and Onboard
2. Retent and Develop
3. Debrief and Severance

### Attract and Onboard

If your car is to take you anywhere it requires fuel - be it fossile fuel running an ICE or some other source of energy. Likewise if your organisation
is to grow it will require manpower.

The first order of business to that end is attracting manpower with the proper set of qualifications and competencies. 

### Retent and Develop

Keeping the workforce contented and motivated is key to accomplicing the objectives set by management.

With society, the environment, and technology constantly changing and advancing, another crucial task is making sure that the manpower is well suited for
the tasks. Training, coaching, education, learning from experienced coworkers is a [benefit to the worker](https://www.princeton.edu/~erossi/LC.pdf) - and to the organiation.

### Debrief and Severance

Manpower is an asset and like other assets it gets consumed and sometimes it gets depleted, outdated, even irrelevant. 

## What tools does SPEICHER provide?

### Planning 

One very important task is applying the optimal amount of manpower to any job. Doing that requires the manager and the group of workers to enter into an agreement on the WHEN, WHO, HOW MUCH with regards to attendance hours.

You will start with defining the locations/work-stations - asset-consuming units be it assembly lines in a factory, positions on a football team, or offices - and their demands for assets.

Then you move on to add the current staff. Add employees and teams and the relationship between teams and employees.

Finally you may add work schedules to both the asset-consumers and asset-providers (locations and employees/teams).

Each employee is able to add their individual work schedules (requirements or wishlists).

The result is an accomplished plan for each location that both the organisation and the employees have to 'ok' before it can be _the approved_ plan.

### Attendance

Registering actual attendance is the natural next step after setting up plans for each location, team, and employee.

Each employee will be able to have an email sent to their inbox with a magic-link saving them to actually logging into SPEICHER.

The web page they see will allow them to _punch_ in, break, out, and sick.
