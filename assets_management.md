## Introduction to Asset Management

### What are assets

If you google 'asset' - one of the first links will take you to Wikipedia. There's [an article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset_classes) 
defining asset classes as a group of financial instruments. Financial assets like stocks and bonds are **one** class of assets!

[Investopedia](https://investopedia.com) distinguishes between [tangible and intangible assets](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/012815/what-difference-between-tangible-and-intangible-assets.asp). Intangible assets like copyrights, patents, and goodwill are **another** class of assets! 

They are all examples of what SPEICHER  **does not** provide tools for managing!

To SPEICHER asset management is about managing _the other_ classes - the tangible assets:

* machines and production equipment
* manpower - employees
* land
* furniture, office space, meeting rooms, cubicles 
* inventories

### What is management

[Indeed.com](https://indeed.com) defines [management as](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/what-is-management)

> Management is the coordination and administration of tasks to achieve a goal. Such administration activities include setting the organizationâ€™s strategy and coordinating the efforts of staff to accomplish these objectives through the application of available resources. 

There are a number of tasks to be performed as a manager but the fundamental ones are:

1. Setting objectives
2. Acquire assets, and utilise assets adequately
3. Measure the utilisation
4. Evaluate objectives vs measurements

\- [rinse and repeat](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Rinse%20And%20Repeat)

If you find these 4 fundamental tasks to 'smell' like [the Deming Cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Edwards_Deming) it's because they are! 

## Objectives

### Purpose

Setting objectives (for yourself, your team, a business unit, the scope does not really matter) requires you to have a purpose, a mission, whether that's being/becoming competitive, staying in business, winning an Olympic Gold Medal, making enough money to get through the day, and more.

### Quantifiable vs Qualifiable tative

Objectives should not be _slogans_ like "we produce with zero defects", _exhortations_ like "never brake the chain of command", and _targets_ like "team B must produce 100 items of product X per hour". The bulk of causes of low quality and/or low productivity belong to the system and are beyond the power of the work force.
