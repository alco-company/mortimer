# CHANGELOG

I started this in another project - hermes - which evolved into 'astronaut' which was a customer project further developed by [Michal Szymanski](https://github.com/michalsz); the basic idea on how to persist data is, however, the same - with 4/5 core entities: Event, Asset, Participant, Message, (and Document). The distinction between Message and Document isn't quite clear because I haven't decided on whether Documents really are a particular form of Messages, or entities in their own right, yet.

In the REFERENCES you will find a lot of people, resources, etc

## TODO 


* radio_field
* TODO: use has_secure_token to allow 'user-less' users access without logging in!
* steps_field - like when you want the user to first finish typing in [fieldset] and then continue to the next [fieldset]
* write some serious tests for people, partners, participants, events, 
* we might need Redis' Sessions store down the road - [here's the low down](https://github.com/redis-store/redis-rails)
* add user profile with some rudimentary settings and ability to fx switch to DarkMode !?
* add Participant addressability - by means of basically one table :0 (URLs are not just webpages, but really any adressable resource!!)
* add second **main feature** - documents (in all their glory and multiversatility, like notes, messages, contracts, SOP's, NDA's, invoices, orders, quotes, etc)
* add third **main feature** - assets (products, work in progress, raw material, machinery, whiteboards, trucks, SIM cards, and more)
* add Team - People are grouped into teams, either in a permanent position as fx a Sales rep in the Sales Team, or a temporary/matrix position as Data Analyst in the Finance Team/Department

* make  H E R M E S  a PWA - use [Kevin Basset's Progressier](https://progressier.com/) &  https://dev.to/zippytyro/how-to-convert-any-website-webpage-into-an-installable-progressive-web-app-pwa-59ai
* 
* Connecting customer specific data through DT (Delegated Types)
* use Chartkick.js for [Presentational Graphics](https://github.com/ankane/chartkick.js)
* use [this recipe](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/how-to-add-file-upload-to-your-graphql-api-34d51e341f38) to add fileupload using GraphQL
* fixing [issues with current_user](https://blog.cloud66.com/making-hotwire-and-devise-play-nicely-with-viewcomponents/) when using Hotwire
* using imagekit.io to building the image library - remember new UI from TailwindUI

* ideas for wms - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nphpy0PH2BE
* ideas for handset/pos  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yu883oEq7A
* checkbox on stock to scan 92___ own barcode w/fixed quantity
* checkbox on stock to scan 93___ own barcode manual entry of quantity
* checkbox on stock to manual entry of quantity on GTIN EAN14
* checkbox on stock to manual entry of best-before on GTIN EAN14
* stock_transaction_processing_job has to start every 2 minute to check if any items to process - ajob for whenever
  * https://medium.com/swlh/automate-tasks-in-rails-using-the-whenever-gem-46f9708ab002
  * https://dokku.com/docs/processes/scheduled-cron-tasks/
  * 
* when we have to add sidekiq - [here's how to do it](https://www.aloucaslabs.com/miniposts/how-to-install-sidekiq-to-a-ruby-on-rails-project-deployed-on-dokku-server) with Dokku, and further [read here](https://kukicola.io/posts/deploying-rails-6-application-with-dokku) too!

* always type '?' in any inputfield (even if it cannot be presented - like checkboxes and radiobuttons) to get to the on screen documentation and help
* always type * in search and lookup fields to have SPEICHER start presenting all the available items
* 

* add paper_trail to abstract_resource - see speicher/hours/src/app/controllers/abstract_resources_controller.rb
* change user_time_zone in ApplicationController to use current_user's timezone - once we have added the User Model
* use github actions (or gitlab equivalent) to do automagic deploys on git push to staging/production branches
* 

! always run `dokku repo:purge-cache staging.greybox.speicher.ltd` before deploying

02:30 - exiting but I have to stop


### 2021-02-26

\- but then just as when everything is about to fall apart, the Sun starts to shine and hands you all you need to keep going!

09:45 - ohh this really does hurt now!
****
* TIL and in [no small part thanks to Ross](https://rossta.net/blog/importing-images-with-webpacker.html) how Webpacker handles images !

02:30 - that'll have to do!


## 2021-02-25

this cold of mine - I mean - it's bad! Didn't I hear myself say this already?

08:10 - better get going

* I'm fighting just about everything today - my cold, and this f"â¬%&-ing Dokku thing, well and Webpacker, and really!

04:45 - okay I'm officially going to quit! This is just insane!

## 2021-02-24

this cold of mine - I mean - it's bad!

EDIT: This all turned into nothing! Now the database in a container - period!

07:05 - hit it

* whoa - big hole in my knowledge! Containers and brew installed PostgreSQL instances do NOT play well together!!
* have to repair my local postgres installation with `rm -rf db/postgres-data/*`  `initdb --pgdata=db/postgres-data/ --encoding=utf8  --locale=en_US --username=postgres -W`
* which includes `DATABASE_URL="postgres://postgres:postgres@postgres/scoop_rover?encoding=utf8&pool=5&timeout=5000" rails db:reset`
* and - no - not `rails c`; all you have to do is `spring stop` first! Then open the console - tricky :)
* now where are my assets? 
* that will have to come - after the break
* add [web app to a container](https://firehydrant.io/blog/developing-a-ruby-on-rails-app-with-docker-compose/)

18:38 - have to stretch my legs and eat something

## 2021-02-23

got myself another one of those long-toothed infections where my nasal cavaties fill with pus - yuck!

07:30 - woke 6:10 with my head full of - well pus - what a way to start a glorious new day?!

* committing stuff from the last two days work
* ignoring .DS_Store files (a macOS thing with) `find . -name .DS_Store -print0 | xargs -0 git rm -f --ignore-unmatch`
* structuring partials around the generic 'list' (/index) action
* added Sidekiq for background jobs

19:15 - now it's time to go get a burger - from Hugo's burgerbar :)

20:30 - that was a lot of meat, well tasting though!

* building a default Docker-ready Rails environment 
* added TailwindCSS forms, typography, and aspect-ratio
* started building the Docker containers - with help from among others https://semaphoreci.com/community/tutorials/dockerizing-a-ruby-on-rails-application 
* `docker-compose run hermes rake db:reset` and now we have development env up and running - but with no Tailwind or assets
* Setting up production purging of superflous TailwindCSS classes
  
23:45 - done and waisted

## 2021-02-22

damn cold - will have to go easy on my self for a while

07:30 - rise and shine some more

* make the global keyboardhandler work like a charm
* add RTF to the event - https://oozou.com/blog/using-actiontext-in-rails-6-85 

17:15 - need a walk and some chow

22:15 - second leg

* safety upload to doing `git remote add gitlab https://gitserver.alco.dk:walther/hermes/v1.git` and `git push -u gitlab --tags`
  
23:59 - no more battery Asiz!

## 2021-02-21

no, no tagfield to day - I've got a cold and need to do something which I don't have to think too much about; any chance?

08:15 - giddy-up

* do steps on the add appointment modal to make it easy

10:15 - having my grandchildren on visit; that stops the press 

13:15 - saw them off and then back to the workbench

* adding trial routes for events, contacts, orders, leads, reports, and more
* apply current git-version to the dashboard for reference

17:30 - Sunday bloody Sunday 

## 2021-02-20

let's leave that tag-field for a moment and build some momentum

07:45 - rise and shine, on a Saturday OMG

* foundation for keyboard handler in application.html.haml - affording Esc-a (add an appointment), Esc-b through Esc-z, and more
* format a modal right
* make sure we set the time right
* likewise make sure to do proper localization
* call modal from dashboard - check
* clear modal - check
* send modal - check

02:25 - this is crazy, but what can I do?

## 2021-02-19

07:45 - early birdish, after a very good night's sleep

* and then on to the tag_field - we'll need it for adding recipients and assignees too

14:15 - it's Friday and it's been one heck of a week 

## 2021-02-18

08:30 oh boy is my body hurting now!

even though we got busy interviewing developers I like to think I had good traction

* moving on with checkbox
* have to move all Coffeescript into neutral corner :D
* with `rails webpacker:install:coffee` affords loading coffee script resources
* next up is text_field

17:00 that'll have to do for now
 

## 2021-02-17

08:00 Another day to die

This was a gastly day productive-wise - praying for a better tomorrow - but it too will hold its challenges: we're interviewing in the morning!

* add chokidar to have easy reload of views

19:45 breaking for late supper

* got the select_field down - only one heck of a lot of field types left

02:00 finalemento for now

## 2021-02-16

08:00 Rise and shine

* logo and colorize /signin
* colorize notifications
* notifications show/hide
* localise /signin
* add sidebar 
* add first **main feature** - calendars (and their events); we'll expand on the Event and utilize EventModel Patterns (however subtle) further down the road
* add Partner
* add Person
* add button for add event - and build rendering partials 
  
18:45 break for dinner

21:00 and we're live

* add event modal - display modal done

22:15 have to give in for the day

## 2021-02-15

06:45 of to the races

* set default language to danish - `gem 'rails-i18n'` and `bundle install` and setup _config/application.rb_
* set time_zone on current user
* add Hotwire for PubSub
* a great job by Chris Oliver with [simple_calendar](https://gorails.com/episodes/vlog-day-6?autoplay=1)
* [add AlpineJS](https://davidteren.medium.com/tailwindcss-2-0-with-rails-6-1-postcss-8-0-9645e235892d) for sprinkling on the DOM - and throw in **alpine-magic-helpers** and **alpine-turbo-drive-adapter** for kicks


17:45 we break for Corona testing!

20:00 back to the trenches

* get the background right - the Powerpoint is far to dark
* add hero for landing_page
* add Mejerigaarden logo - TODO better quality from marketing - masked positive
* add navbar
* started building a dashboard (example)

01:30 no more juice in the code guns


## 2021-02-12

07:45 auch - body hurts

* tests still not running smoothly - having trouble with the C in CRUD on controller tests

08:30 paused due to meet

10:45 resume

* sometimes testing is stating the obvious `ActiveModel::Error attribute=user_name, type=taken, options={:value=>"mystring1"}` which actually is a good thing - 'cause it makes us write more and better tests!
* add another _small_ **feature** - action_text which will allow for very nice content management - perhaps not on par with Word but close enough - use [this gist](https://gist.github.com/adrienpoly/e318bd9f559d487cffb11eb84ead2655) - yet actiontext is part of Rails 6.1.3 already. Now _just_ add `has_rich_text :content` to any model, update the **_form**, and remember to add **:content** to [class]_params
* add yet another **feature** - ActiveStorage affording attachments onto every record; use [this post](https://pragmaticstudio.com/tutorials/using-active-storage-in-rails) to do the lifting

13:30 weekend came to soon 
### 2021-02-11

08:30 encore

making considerable more progress - what a joy!

* initial `rails new hermes`
* setup `bin/development` to run development workbench
* ~~ignore /db/postgres-data and /dump.rdb~~ [26/2/21 now this is all in containers and volumes/handled by Docker]
* run `rails db:create` to ascertain the connection to the DB
* add PaperTrail gem for versioning of tables
* add CoffeeScript gem for easy javascript
* add Haml for HTML/CSS sugar
* run `bundle install`to pick up gems added
* add a landing_page - `rails g controller landing_page index` - and add `root to: "landing_page#index"` to `config/routes.rb`
* add TailwindCSS - use [this work](https://willschenk.com/articles/2020/tailwind_and_rails/)
* make HTML files all new again with `for f in **/*.html.erb; do html2haml $f ${f/\.html\.erb/.html.haml}; rm $f; done`
* add first datatable - versioning - `rails g paper_trail:install` - and close the stunt with `rails db:migrate`
* add cornerstone table - accounts - allowing this to run as a multi-tenant SaaS; `rails g scaffold account partner_id:bigint name service_plan`
* remember to allow Account to inherit from VersionedRecord, and as usual - `rails db:migrate`
* immediately following the Account, here goes Participant which is _the second most important class_ - `rails g model participant account:references name ancestry`
* add _has_secure_password_ - follow [this excellent work](https://gist.github.com/iscott/4618dc0c85acb3daa5c26641d8be8d0d)
* initially we'll need a user - `rails g scaffold user account:references participant:references user_name password_digest`
* make sure PaperTrail knows who's at the steering wheel -  `before_action :set_paper_trail_whodunnit` in ApplicationController - once `current_user` has been implemented

11:45 closing shop for now - has to attend a funeral

15:30 and again

better give testing some thought - coverage is rather bleak atm :( but than again it's not mission critical business logic we're rolling, not yet!

* make sessions new, create, destroy green
* make CRUD actions on accounts and users pass - presented a small challenge as part of the testing framework has been 'rewired' in recent years and this is really my first TDD journey for quite some time

19:15 hunger sets in

21:15 this will be a brief epilog for the day

* that challenge which dinner so abruptly forced me to part with - turned out to be little more than `<%= BCrypt::Password.create('MyString', cost: 5) %>` inside _fixtures/users.yml_ - the rest had been prepared already
* one of the minor **features** is for records to be taggable - `rails g scaffold tag name taggables_count`
 
22:00 better hit the sack - three very late nights is one too many


### 2021-02-10

13:15 ignition

spent ~14hrs - closing shop at 03:15AM - to no avail due to latest library updates all around the 'table' >:( but such is life, but what a bummer to start off on a project with such a wrong turn :(

03:15 burnt down


## DIDN'T HAPPEN

* woops wrong ruby! `asdf install ruby 3.0.0 && asdf local ruby 3.0.0 && asdf reshim`
* application.js missing!?! 
* trying with adding yarn to Dockerfile - check!
* and let's migrate immediately - `docker-compose run --rm web rails db:migrate`
* documenting VersionedRecord class which most other models will inherit from
