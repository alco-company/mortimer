# ERP

enterprise resource planning

## Idea

make a fast buck or a teleportation gadget to wear on your wrist

## Assets

machines - without them you don't need any of the other (if that very machine is essential of cause)
material - with the proper machine and right material you may need fewer men (but perhaps more money)
men - from board to bin each signed head should count
money - with the rest in place all you have left is 'ask'
